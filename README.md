ou ask? What a great question and I love your go gettum attitude!

I decided to make a repository to show how I approach all the changes to my website. Recently I've decided to approach any problem I had programmatically..programmacally...programmaticalerlyness...anyway. Approach it in a way that I use programming to help me overcome what challenges I face with it or use programming in a way to help me better understand the issue.

### that's the general idea, super vague but okay

My site is a static, pretty cut and dry, easy to try-at-home, HTML and github.pages site. The reason I went with this is because I'm fully aware of all the fancy shmancy frameworks and automations out there for making a website but I do not have as much experience with all those bells and whistles. 

How I learn about something is reinventing the wheel, and I try to see if I can make my own (__albeit, robust__) versions of everything using what I already know how to do in Python.

### why python

I don't know. Years ago I made a decision to learn programming and then the next decision I made (which took me way too long to be honest) was which language I should pick. I was between Ruby and Python. I honestly think I picked Python because well...ahem..I'm a Slytherin...

I hope all the logic behind that extremely justified decision doesn't hurt your brain.

### back to what's important.

right now the problem I'm working on with my website is redesigning the blog roll to look pretty.

**the challenge** is that I've hardcoded all the information in on the blog roll. So in addition to writing an entirely new one, I want to avoid the copy-pasta workflow I have and design a python implementation that will create and insert the new code for me.

# BUT

in addition to that, I have to transfer over all the other blog posts. So I will be writing a scraper/builder of sorts.

Let me know what you think.

Or don't. Do you.
